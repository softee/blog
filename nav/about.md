I graduated from Zhejiang University in China. And my major was Tourism Management. I clearly remember that when i was a freshman, i planed to study Mathematics or Computer Science. I like Math and i think coding is pretty cool all the time. Unfortunately i couldn't transfer into Department of Mathematics or Computer Science. Because i was a arts student in high school and my grading ranking was not quite good. 

Do not be discouraged! If you don't give it up, finally it will come true!

When i worked for some years, i studied coding by myself. Luckly i found a job in a software company, and did it good. Git and github are very popular. So i try to use them in my projects, and it's awesome! Now i create my personal blog by github. I'm going to record coding problems and some thoughts here.
